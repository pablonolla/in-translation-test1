        <h1>Translation is...</h1>
        <h2>Ella Sherr</h2>  
        <p>Translation is the reason all of us, readers, authors, publishers and agents - love our jobs.</p>
        <p>Translation is what makes us feel so deeply proud of what we write, or read, or discover.</p>
        <p>I like to think of my literary agency as a way to build bridges made of good literature.</p>
        <p>Being an Italian, with a Spanish oriented agency, while living most of my days in Lisbon, makes me feel at home in every place and a foreign everywhere.</p>
        <p>I truly believe that translation is the engine of what we do, in every language and to every language.</p>
        <p>It's amazing when we see we all are part of the same team: the author, the agent, the publisher, the foreign publisher and the translator. It's the reason I love my job.</p>
        <p>Being here is the best way for me to strengthen the agency's relationship with translators and it's a beautiful opportunity to make those bridges even stronger!</p>
